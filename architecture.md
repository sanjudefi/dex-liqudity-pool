# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Smart Contract Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture and key components of the DEX smart contract.

## Overview

The DEX smart contract is designed to facilitate decentralized token trading and liquidity provision. It includes several key components and functions:

- **Liquidity Pool**: Users can add liquidity to the DEX by depositing tokens into the liquidity pool. Liquidity providers earn a share of trading fees.

- **Token Trading**: Users can initiate token trades within the DEX. A 5% trading fee is applied to each trade, contributing to the income of liquidity providers.

- **Fee Distribution**: Trading fees are distributed to liquidity providers based on their share of the liquidity pool.

## Smart Contract Components

### Owner

The owner is the creator of the smart contract and has special privileges, such as the ability to set the trading fee percentage.

### Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers are users who deposit tokens into the liquidity pool. They receive a share of trading fees proportional to their contribution to the pool.

### Token

The token being traded on the DEX. Users must have access to this token to interact with the DEX.

### Liquidity Pool

The liquidity pool stores the tokens deposited by liquidity providers. It keeps track of the total liquidity and the shares of individual providers.

### Trading Fee

A 5% trading fee is applied to each trade within the DEX. This fee is collected from the trader and distributed to liquidity providers.

## Interaction Flow

1. Liquidity providers add tokens to the liquidity pool using the `addLiquidity` function.

2. Traders initiate token trades using the `trade` function, which incurs a 5% trading fee.

3. Trading fees are collected and distributed to liquidity providers based on their share of the pool using the `distributeTradingFee` function.

## Security Considerations

- Security audits and testing are critical to ensure the safety of user funds and contract functionality.

- Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including KYC and AML, may be necessary when deploying a production-ready DEX.

## Future Enhancements

- Order matching and order book management for more advanced trading functionality.

- Integration with external identity verification services for KYC compliance.

- Improved user interface for a user-friendly DEX experience.
