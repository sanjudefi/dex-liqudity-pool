# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Smart Contract

This is a simplified implementation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) smart contract. Users can add liquidity to the DEX pool and trade tokens while earning a share of the 5% trading fees.

## Features

- **Liquidity Pool**: Users can add liquidity to the DEX by depositing tokens into the liquidity pool.

- **Token Trading**: Users can trade tokens within the DEX, with a 5% trading fee applied to each trade.

- **Fee Distribution**: A portion of the trading fees is distributed to liquidity providers based on their share of the pool.

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.

2. Users can interact with the smart contract by adding liquidity and trading tokens.

3. Liquidity providers earn a share of the trading fees generated from token trades.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or deploy the smart contract to your blockchain network.

2. Customize the contract as needed for your specific use case.

3. Ensure you have the necessary tools and infrastructure to interact with the smart contract, such as a compatible wallet and blockchain network access.

4. Deploy the contract and provide documentation to users on how to use it.
